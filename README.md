## MRes Work

Omar Tanner's MRes Work at the University of Cambridge.

### MRes Project

Beating main-memory bandwidths for geospatial computation via cache-optimised in-memory data compression. Implemented in C++ (7k word limit).

Code available [here](https://github.com/omarathon/compression-geospatial).

### 4F13 Probabalistic Machine Learning

Two courseworks in MATLAB (Probabalistic Ranking, Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model) for which I received an indicative grade of A- (5 page limit for each). 

**Report:** prob_ml.pdf

### L48 Machine Learning and the Physical World Project

Group project applying applying bayesian optimisation with a gaussian process surrogate to automatically tune PPO (an RL algorithm). Implemented in Python (9 page limit).

**Report:** ml_physical.pdf

### 4B25 Embedded Systems Project

Algorithm development in C on a resource-constrained board for activity probability measurement using an IMU (2 page limit).

**Report:** emb_sys.pdf

### Sensor Design Project

Implementation and calibration of temperature and pulse sensors (3k word limit).
